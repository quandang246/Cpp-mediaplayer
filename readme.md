# Media Files Browser & Player CLI Application

This is a CLI (Command Line Interface) application written in C++ for Linux systems, designed to serve as a basic media files browser and player. The application allows users to navigate through directories, view media files, create playlists, view metadata of media files, edit metadata, and play music using SDL2/taglib library. 

## Requirements

- Linux Operating System (Currently, I'm using Ubuntu 20.04)
- Compiler C++20 (Maybe C++17 can also work)
- Taglib Library
- SDL2 Library
- CMake (Currently, I'm using CMake 3.16.3)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/quandang246/Cpp-mediaplayer.git
    ```

2. Compile the taglib:

    ```bash
    cd path-to-taglib
    mkdir build
    cd build/
    cmake -S .. -B .
    make
    sudo make install 
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd path-to-Cpp-mediaplayer
    ```

3. Compile the source code:

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build/
    cmake -S .. -B .
    make
    sudo make install 
    ```

4. Run the application (can run anywhere in your computer):

    ```bash
    media 
    ```

## Usage
